Identifying material properties via optimisation algorithms and finite elements


Model problem: Consider a 1D linear elastic rod being stretched by 100%. It is made of three parts of equal lengths of Young’s moduli ½ E, E and  k E, for the first third, second third and third third, respectively. Using an optimisation method of your choice and a programming language of your choice (explaining your choices), find k such that the first two thirds of the rod stretch by 50% altogether, and the last third by 200%.
